# TDD & BDD Final Project ðŸ§ª
This project was developed as the final deliverable for the **"Introduction to Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development"** course, part of the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python 3.9
- Flask
- Pytest (TDD)
- Behave (BDD)
- Docker

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This microservice simulates a simple product management API. The main goal of this project was to apply **TDD and BDD methodologies** in a realistic setting.

The following were implemented:
- Unit tests for service routes and models using `pytest`
- Feature scenarios using `behave` in Gherkin syntax
- API endpoints in `service/routes.py`
- Step definitions and BDD logic with `features/steps`

## ðŸ§ª Test Examples
Unit tests are located in `tests/test_models.py` and `tests/test_routes.py`.

To run unit tests:
```
pytest
```
To run BDD scenarios:
```
behave
```
